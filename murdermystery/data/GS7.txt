Wil=I’m glad you’re all here now.
mcN=What happened?
Mag=Sasha’s…dead!
mcN=What???
Mag=We found her body in the laboratory!
mcN=What laboratory?
Ros=Sorry I forgot to mention it earlier, there's now a door to a lab south of the lobby.
Ang=This is fine…it will all be just fine.
Tha=We better get on with our investigation, no?
Tha=How do we want to do this?
Wil=I say we all split up and individually look for evidence.
mcN=We can’t do that. There’s no way that we can make sure people won’t tamper with things.
Neb=Honor code?
Mag=I don’t think that will be good enough.
Mag=We can split up into partners, so we can hold each other accountable.
Wil=I prefer to work alone.
Ros=I prefer to have untouched evidence.
mcN=If anyone sees their partner doing anything suspicious, let the group know during the trial.
Tha=How should we decide on groups?
Emi=I’ll go with Magnolia if that’s okay with you guys.
Ang=And I’ll go with Nebula.
Ros=I guess that leaves me with Willow.
Wil=I told you, I can investigate on my own.
Ros=I’m not saying I don’t trust you, but I don’t trust you.
Ros=You’re sticking with me.
Wil=Fine. Don’t slow me down.
mcT=What’s her deal?
mcN=We’ll meet back here soon?
Ros=Sounds good, I’m sure there will be an announcement before the trial happens.
