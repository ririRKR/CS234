Mag=Magnolia Sparks, at your service.
mcN=What brings you here this evening?
Mag=Well, I was hired to fix the electricity around this place.
Mag=The owner said she’s been having trouble with the digital locks.
mcN=What’s wrong with them?
Mag=Well, before, they weren’t working.
Mag=Now they won’t open…which means we’re stuck here.
mcN=Do you think you could open them?
Mag=I would try to mess with the system, but I don’t want to take my chances with electrocution. 
mcN=I already talked to Magnolia about the locks. I should probably talk to other people around the hotel.

mcN=Hello miss, are you perchance Thalia Lynx?
Tha=...yes?
Tha=How do you know my name?
mcT=I feel like I know her from somewhere…but the memory feels just beyond reach.
mcN=Lucky guess.
mcN=What are you up to Thalia?
Tha=I’m looking for security cameras.
mcT=That’s not suspicious at all.
mcN=Why?
Tha=For Sasha’s blueprint. I wasn’t doing much, so when she asked for help I thought I’d assist her.
mcN=How many cameras have you found so far?
Tha=So far I’ve found two: one in the top left and bottom right corners of the room.
Tha=The cameras are well hidden, so I’m sure there are others I haven’t found yet.
Tha=I’m going to keep looking. See you around!
Tha=I haven’t found any new cameras yet…sorry.

Ros=So...why does this door have a really large lock on it?
Wil=It looks like a security room of some sort.
mcT=There is a sign on the door.
mcT=It says: Only open during investigations.
mcT=I wonder what that could mean?
mcN=What is going on?
Wil=Oh nothing. We’re just standing here looking at a door for no reason.
Wil=Use your common sense. We’re trying to get a door unlocked.
Ros=Be kind.
Ros=We found a door, but it’s locked for some reason, and we don’t know why.
Ros=I’m Rosalie Andrews, computer programmer.
Ros=And this rude one is Willow Griffin. She’s an artist.
Ros=But with her ego, I wouldn’t be surprised if she calls herself the “Ultimate Artist” or something.
Ros=Don’t listen to her, she’s just conceded.
Wil=I heard that.
Wil=I don’t want to talk to you right now.
mcT=She seems busy. I should talk to other people instead.
